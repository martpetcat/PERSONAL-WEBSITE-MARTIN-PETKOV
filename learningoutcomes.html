        <h3><span class="h-light">TIMES PROVEN: 2</span></h3>
        <h4> Action: Team Charter - MOSCOW & Risk Assestments</h4>

        
        <p> The way, I contributed to the Project Organisation is by <span class="h-light">assisting my teammates in the Project Plan, helping to distinguish, focusing on what needed to be done.</span> These tasks required the whole teams attention and decision.</p>
        
        <p>We learned how to prioritize objectives through lessons and activities, throughout the first weeks.<span class="h-light"> The MoSCoW method, Team Charter and Risk Assestment are my earliest contributions to the group,</span> that helped us form a solid foundation to later expand on.</p> 

        <div class="image-align">

          <img src="doc.png" class="image" alt="setup">
        </div>

        <p> During that phase, we estimated the <span class="h-light">probabilities of not delivering certain parts</span> of our project, establishing <span class="h-light">the mandatory ones and the ones that were optional</span>. During the first weeks I assisted with the <span class="h-light">Team Charter</span> in which we added things such as the <span class="h-light">MosCoW Diagram, Risk Assessment, Project Plan.</span></p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <h3>None given for this step</h3>
                        
        <h4>Decision</h4>
        <p>We managed to find a solution to the problems we established, through rules that the group agreed on. We would put that in our agreement and I would move on to the next step.</p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>

        <p>Looking back we had a strong foundation on which our communication</span> relied and I feel as if that's the thing that helped us finish tasks fast. We came up with a solution on the treats we as a team would encounter.</p>

        <h4>Action: Poster</h4>

        <p>As a team we had to create a poster together. I created the logo and the elements that go with it, like the slogan I made then, "Bringing you the Goods". Afterwards, we would present in front of the class and would get feedback on our idea which was a Coffee Shop Delivery service. I tried to make the logo by <span class="h-light">applying what I learned from the lesson about design we had - the GESTALT Method.</span></p>

          <img src="poster_feedback.png" class="image" alt="poster">      
        </div>

        <h4>Decision</h4>

        <p>We discused the feedback with the group and I fixed the logo later which would then become to better suit the theme of the website and its theme, backed by research I did on other websites of similar theme: </p>

        <div class="image-align">

          <img src="logo_refined.png" class="image" alt="refined"> 
        </div>

        <p> I redesigned the logo based on research and the theme we were trying to convey. Before that we would make a more simple version so we could start with the prototyping.</p>

        <!-- <p></p>Whenever we as a group got feedback on the confusing layout and unfitting theme, I vouched to redesign it,<span class="h-light">implementing the feedback that Lodi gave - play with the idea more.</span> So, I added custom features to the website, in its most recent look, to enchance the idea of it. I concluded to all of these changes after doing more recerach for our website, looking for spottable trends in other websites.</p> -->

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>Although, our team may fall behind at times, I belive that our communication, and way fo adjusting around each other helps us push through these hurdles, further approved by the meetup we had earlier in which we made it certain, that we would be start working on the coding of the website this weekend.</p>

        <p>I partook greatly in the<span class="h-light">wireframes, pitching, and refining</span>of our website as shown throughout learning outcomes my strenght comes in the desinging department, and thats what I tried to assist with primarily.</p>
        <!-- 2 pics  -->
        <p> As a team, I find us easily working off of eachother, assinging roles, and changing them. I'd say that we're all very flexible but had problems with our personal website - <span class="h-light"> we all went too in depth on the designing of our individual projects, which would later stress us out immensely.</span> <br> Because of our synergy as a group, even whenver we would fall behind, we would quikly catch up the distance, and that's something very aparent from our delivery thus far. - <span class="h-light">Whenever we've felt behind we've always shifted or focus towards the right objectives.</span></p>

        <p>We as a group, realize these mistakes of ours and are ready to put in the work to present the website in a good condition.</p>

        <h4>· Action · Personal ·</h4>

        <p> For my<span class="h-light">Personal Website</span> I approached it kind of the same way. I prioritized the Learning Outcomes whist builing a whole theme to support my website. However, as later seen through reflection it would become aparent, that at times that was my weakness as well.</p>

        <h4> Feedback</h4>

        <p>Through the <span class="h-light">early stage of development</span>, I mostly used Figma, and was spending way too much time on <span class="h-light">refining the wireframes and later the design.</span> Through embracement of feedback, I've picked up pace and have actively documented my decisions, mistakes and have given my reflection times, and times again, and this one is no different. Through the teachers willingness to help me <span class="h-light">understand, that failing is not that bad after all, you have to try once again,</span> and so afterwards, I slowly picked up my pace by starting with the website.</p>

        <!-- peer review, talks with chris, that one w lars  -->

        <h4> Decision</h4>

        <p> By the time, I got to reflect on my shortcomings with the website being started <span class="h-light">a bit later, I managed to progress fast,</span> as I did the "HOME" page for my website, which <span class="h-light">I would show alongside learning outcomes, progressively changing it as it started coming into its own.</span> Shortly, after establishing the landing page, I begun working on this page, and that has been my main focus for a while, getting feedback from teachers about changes, and implementing them actively. Now that it's mostly done, I will me <span class="h-light">switching my focus on the group project, and finishing the Gallery page of my website, as it's essentical</span> (if possible)</p>

        <h4> Reflection</h4>
        <p> I have managed to give the websites <span class="h-light">most</span> of its important features/content. I <span class="h-light">will try</span> to add the last thing that, I think is needed in this short span of time, I have set up to have - <span class="h-light">Gallery page, if possible while working with my team.</span> My teammates, too are working on their portfolios but, I think, I will be taking the initiative on the coding of the pages so, I can ensure that, I do my part in the team and give us momentum - <span class="h-light">something, I, myself have been known to lack on.</span>  So I will begin the coding of the project in the nearest future, myself <span class="h-light">which is a big leap, but I want to prove that, I have improved.</span></p>
        
        <h4>Action:</h4>

        <p>I partook greatly in the creation of the wireframes and pitches of the website, I've researched our theme and made changes according to feedback.</p>

        <p>Last week, I <span class="h-light">took action, seeked my coach, and my teachers to discuss my progress with them,focusing on reflection of recent events in my personal and professional environment.</span>They, have been made aware a while ago about my lacking mental health, the reason, I failed first semester - but I don't want to be held back by this state of mind anymore - and I'm trying to prove just that.</p>
                
        <p>But this time around its different - I have trust in my teachers, myself, and my colleagues, and though, <span class="h-light">I strayed from the path at times, I always found my back on track, through remaining unbiased to teachers thoughts and feelings and respecting their decisions.</span></p>

        <p>Following logic, during the desinging phase of my website (in Figma), I've done my research on the website's theme and have documented the most improtant moments</p>
        
        <p>Home page is separated in 4 parts. Each section contributes stylistically to the other ones. It's theme is a mixture of <span class="h-light">various influences and elements.</span> It's styling has a <span class="h-light">strongly influenced by the Y2k style,</span>with oceanic elements surrounding it, through my <span class="h-light">national roots - mirrored in an altered version which are my international influences, tying this chaos into a personal, melancholy, yet colourful, grimy world which is my imagination,</span>and over this period, it has become <span class="h-light">crucial for me to let these feelings out</span> - which I do best, my own way.</p>

        <p>I drew the inspiration for my website through  <span class="h-light">a couple of different feelings I wanted to capture.</span>I wanted to represent my Bulgarian roots, through a meaningful video in the main section. Then I wanted to introduce myself, my hobbies, without telling anything that was not needed. The next part has a slideshow of small technical tasks I've had this semester. Next to it is a song playlist,  <span class="h-light">and hopefully it comes to fruition, otherwise I will be coming up with an alternative approach</span>. These are essential parts of the design which I hope to add on time as they bring the whole theme forward. </p>
        <p>
        As research for the website's theme I went in with the before mentioned <span class="h-link"><a href="https://neronestudio.com"  class="h-link">Nerone Studio - a Buglarian clothing brand - because of its layout and theme</a></span>, <span class="h-link"><a href="https://www.kauaiweddingplanner.com"  class="h-link"> this wedding website with a gorgeous oceanic theme,</a></span>, another <span class="h-link"><a href="https://www.https://goclub.world"  class="h-link">Bulgarian website with a strong y2k background</a></span> - which had a y2k theme I looked further for stumbling across this clothing website<span class="h-link"><a href="https://namedcollective.com/collections/shop-our-sh-t"  class="h-link">The Named Collective (FLASH WARNING)</a></span>  </p>

        <p>simultaniously, I have actively<span class="h-light">had clear communication with my teachers - stakeholders - about my idea, have received guidance, most improtantly when, I've fallen short and, I believe that this effort, I've been putting in will pay off.</span></p>

        <h2>Feedback and Reflection</h2>

        <h3>Continuous feedback loop helping prove my progress...</h3>

        <h4> ACTION </h4>
       
        <p>For my <span class="h-light"> Professional skills</span> - communication with teachers, coaches, and colleagues better, is something, I knew, yet have been practiving more and more as of lately. I sat down with my coach, and discussed with them, my progress, shared some insights about other talks, I've had that have helped me improve myself. I came to realize, though the talks with Chris and Lars where, I had fallen short. Petra's simple, yet great advice has been really beneficial for the development of the website.</p> 
        
        <p>On the <span class="h-light">Technical side</span> as well, I ahve been actively improving, becomign faster, understanding my field better, grasping concepts, that I've been impelmenting with the right approach. I however got side-tracked at a point. I was getting too focused on the ideal structure of the website to the point that all, I was doing for a short time is procrastinate, and not begin my project - which is an issue that, I have now resolved, through communication with Corrie and Dirk, mostly.</p>

        <h4> Feedback & Decision</h4>

        <p>Throughout our effort as a group I've found myself in a <span class="h-light">untempered, yet fast-paced manouver of the group</span> as a whole. Teachers, us ourselves have noticed that for one reason or another, <span class="h-light">we're not performing to the best of our abilities,</span> because I find us working towards our goals sporadicly, yet we always achieve the end goal - It's the same in a personal plan.<span class="h-light">Through feedback given we believe that we're going to resolve these issues of hesitancy at times - both on group and personal projects.</span> I can only speak for myself, that  <span class="h-light">I feel refined and grown since the beginning of this semester, and that I am ready to move forward.</span> </p>
        
        <p>Throughout our effort as a team we've tried to be as transparent as possible about our opinions. Without the auditional acknowledgement, we came to have later on for each other, the feelings of lessened progression stopped creeping upon us, as thought focusing on other's work and implementing better communication, we've once again become to overcome <span class="h-light">other hurdles each one of us is experiencing, and because of the easy communication with my teammates, which is something that, although, I haven't had much of earlier, I am finding my place it feels like for me. <span class="h-light">I have a feeling that I have become better at communication due to frequent feedbacks and reflections.</span>I find us growing and progressing actively. We had a meeting earlier where we discussed the coding and I think, we're ready to move on to that.</p>

        <h3>You identify your own core values. You make considered choices for your development and your study program.</h3>

        <h4>Action</h4>

        <p>We had a task about persevierance and the whole meaning of Core Values as a requirement. Through this exersise I rated myself and others. We each got our moments of reflection on our strong and weak sides.</p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>I got evaluated as someone who <span class="h-light">joins well when working, I am best at giving and receiving opininons, though I sometimes get distracted.</span> I have come to <span class="h-light">understand things about myself,</span>though previously evident we're not certain to me until this reflection. This has both helped my work at Fontys, as well as my personal life.</p>

        <h4>Decision</h4>
        <p>After this needed evaluation, <span class="h-light">we synergized better than before and have begun managing as a team, once again.</span>We've come to the decision to work on the group website over the weekend, managing what's left of our personal websites on the side, for the greater good of the team.</p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>We graded eachother on our skills. This evaluation definately <span class="h-light">helped us a lot to grow as a team</span> and fix past mistakes we've made</p>


        <p>We talked in dept about our strong features, our shortcomings, how we could change for the better in certain aspects, how we could contribute to eachother as well. <span class="h-light">And from the feedback that I've received, I believe that, I've improved greatly as of late</span> - emphesised by other teachers' feedback as well.</p>

        <h2>Trends & Developments</h2>
        <h3>Exploring current trends and developments influencing our project...</h3>

        <h4> Action </h4>

        <p>As I transitioned my focus <span class="h-light">from the Figma to the HTML,</span>after reflecting on what went well and what went bad I begun working on the <span class="h-light">Home Page</span> which is my landing page.</p>
          
        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        
        <p>Shortly after feedback, however I changed my focus on <span class="h-light">The Learning Outcomes page</span> and have prioritised it for a week to ensure that every teacher that can view it in its best state. I've done my best through feedback and reflection to ensure that the webpage is in its best shape.</p>
        
        <p> While making this really important part of my website, <span class="h-light">I went through struggles on how to implement it with the style I was going for.</span> I tried making a slideshow out of the menu so I can fit both Technical and Professional skills on the same page, that way, I don't mess up the set styling of my website, and page. Here's how it looked previously.</p>

        <div class="image-align">
          <img src="webpagebefore.png" class="image" alt="before Feedback">
          <img src="afterwebsite.png" class="image" alt="after Feedback">

          <img src="research2.png" class="image" alt="research">          
        </div>

        <p> This way I managed to fix the issue I had been encountering with the menu being confusing and not fitting</p>

        <div class="image-align">
          <img src="messywebpage2.png" class="image" alt="before Feedback">
          <img src="messywebpage.png" class="image" alt="after Feedback"> 
          <img src="webpagefeedback.png" class="image" alt="after Feedback">

          <img src="slideshow_break.png" class="image" alt="breakign slideshow">         
        </div>  

        <h4>Decision</h4>

        <p>I took this decision by evaluating what I <span class="h-light">would be losing if I was to change the style now.</span> To get to this final version I had to do research on it. These were my main sources. <span class="h-light">One is code</span><a class="h-link" href="https://codepen.io/dwinatech/pen/NWRPOdE"><span class="h-light"> that I used from a template I found.</a>This is its most barebones version which, I have greatly changed to suit my website. The code's use here is a navigation bar and multiple sections, common for article pages.</span>This system allows for easy navigation through different sections of the document using the links in the navigation bar. Each section is <span class="h-light">well-organized with headers, paragraphs, and lists, which makes it suitable for documentation which fits the way the rest of the website is structured with clear showcases of content.</span> The last one is inspiration for the webpage I found.</p>

        </div>  

        <h4> Reflection</h4>

        <p>The building of this website was a challenge primarily because of <span class="h-light">how much content I had to fit.</span> With the confusion I had until, I managed to break things <span class="h-light">one by one.</span></p>

        <p>One of the biggest mistakes that occured with the buildign of this page was <span class="h-light">structure. Even afte getting the template, I needed to changes, add the symentic structure that was missing, figuring out a problem with the menu, mistakenly name something wrong, etc.</span> so I could find issues that had risen when implementing the template. Later, I would fix it.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Through doing <span class="h-light">pitches for the website, and adding the most important elements using the MoSCoW method</span> (we as a team did), I created half of the website's layout, starting with the first version based on further research I later did and displayed in Figma which is something, I have showcased multiple times.</p>
        
        <p>After creating some Figma pitches me and another teammate split the website and each did the wireframe for it in Figma.</p>

        <p>In the refinement of the website, that I have previously documented I used a logo created by me in the first weeks when we were selling idea in front of the classes. We've went through changes with the design multiple times, last time redesinged by me. I updated the logo as well, based on previous feedback.</p>
