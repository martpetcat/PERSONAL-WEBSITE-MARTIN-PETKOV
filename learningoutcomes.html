        <h2>Project Organisation</h2>

        <h4> Action: Team Charter - MOSCOW & Risk Assestments</h4>

        
        <p> The way, I contributed to the Project Organisation is by <span class="h-light">assisting my teammates in the Project Plan, helping to distinguish, focusing on what needed to be done.</span> These tasks required the whole teams attention and decision.</p>
        
        <p>We learned how to prioritize objectives through lessons and activities, throughout the first weeks.<span class="h-light"> The MoSCoW method, Team Charter and Risk Assestment are my earliest contributions to the group,</span> that helped us form a solid foundation to later expand on.</p> 

        <div class="image-align">

          <img src="doc.png" class="image" alt="setup">
        </div>

        <p> During that phase, we estimated the <span class="h-light">probabilities of not delivering certain parts</span> of our project, establishing <span class="h-light">the mandatory ones and the ones that were optional</span>. During the first weeks I assisted with the <span class="h-light">Team Charter</span> in which we added things such as the <span class="h-light">MosCoW Diagram, Risk Assessment, Project Plan.</span></p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <h3>None given for this step</h3>
                        
        <h4>Decision</h4>
        <p>We managed to find a solution to the problems we established, through rules that the group agreed on. We would put that in our agreement and I would move on to the next step.</p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>

        <p>Looking back we had a strong foundation on which our communication</span> relied and I feel as if that's the thing that helped us finish tasks fast. We came up with a solution on the treats we as a team would encounter.</p>

        <h4>Action: Poster</h4>

        <p>As a team we had to create a poster together. I created the logo and the elements that go with it, like the slogan I made then, "Bringing you the Goods". Afterwards, we would present in front of the class and would get feedback on our idea which was a Coffee Shop Delivery service. I tried to make the logo by <span class="h-light">applying what I learned from the lesson about design we had - the GESTALT Method.</span></p>

          <img src="poster_feedback.png" class="image" alt="poster">      
        </div>

        <h4>Decision</h4>

        <p>We discused the feedback with the group and <span class="h-light">I fixed the logo later which would then become to better suit the theme of the website,</span> backed by research I did on other websites of similar theme: </p>

          <img src="logo_refined.png" class="image" alt="refined"> 
        </div>

        <p> I redesigned the logo <span class="h-light">based on research and the theme we were trying to convey.</span> Before that we would make a more simple version so we could start with the prototyping.</p>

        <h2>Communication & Reporting</h2>

        <h3>You take the direct stakeholder into account when working on an assignment. You pay attention to what you want to communicate, and in which shape you do this. You are aware of bias and the consequences bias could have.</h3>

        <h4>Action</h4>

        <p>Last week, I <span class="h-light">took action, seeked my coach, and my teachers to discuss my progress with them,focusing on reflection of recent events in my personal and professional environment.</span>I have spoken to teachers and peers and have been trying to improve myself.</p>
                
        <p>I have 17 feedbacks thus far and in some of them, its documented extensively the effort I've poured into the tasks in question then. I have been writting longer texts, giving more exmaples in means to imrpove documentation - the main focus - based on feedback and by following this logic, I've managed to finally feel like I am no longer procrastinating and worrying that I am behind. <span class="h-light">I strayed from the path at times, I always found my back on track, through remaining unbiased to teachers thoughts and feelings and respecting their decisions.</span></p>

        <h4> Feedback </h4>

        <p>Feedback from Petra and Chris was  <span class="h-light">greatly needed for me to pick the pace up, and through recent feedback that, I can put as proof, once again, I am confirming that, in my opinion, I have learned from my mistakes, and overcome them</span> - as seen through these screenshots, I've started actively reflecting on my work with stakeholders alike.</p>

        <p>These discussions reinforced my documentation practices as the ammount of advice and support I've gathered from these feedbacks has become eye opening. I believe through these talks, I have brought myself back on pace by growing as a person, and in a professional setting as well. <span class="h-light">I believe that I have covered these skills efficiently.</span></p>

        <h4> Action: Personal Project development</h4>

        <p>Following logic, during the desinging phase of my website (in Figma), I've done my research on the website's theme and have documented the most improtant moments</p>
        
        <p>Home page is separated in 4 parts. Each section contributes stylistically to the other ones. It's theme is a mixture of <span class="h-light">various influences and elements.</span> It's styling has a <span class="h-light"> has various inspirations ,</span> all ocming into one own style. This website features a Gallery page which I've documented extensively through my word documentation, which has the rest of the proofs I didn't have time to document on the page. The gallery page is the most evident page behind my influences featuring some personal elements with a melancholy, yet colourful, grimy world that I have showcased though my cutout-inspired imagery.</p>
        
        <div class="image-align">

          <img src="home_2ndpart.png" class="image" alt="home 2">        
        </div>
        
        <p>I drew the inspiration for my website through  <span class="h-light">a couple of different feelings I wanted to capture.</span>I wanted to represent my Bulgarian roots, through a meaningful video in the main section. Then I wanted to introduce myself, my hobbies, without telling anything that was not needed. The next part has a slideshow of small technical tasks I've had this semester. Next to it is a song playlist,  <span class="h-light">and hopefully it comes to fruition, otherwise I will be coming up with an alternative approach</span>. These are essential parts of the design which I hope to add on time as they bring the whole theme forward. </p>
        <p>
        As research for the website's theme I went in with the before mentioned <span class="h-link"><a href="https://neronestudio.com"  class="h-link">Nerone Studio - a Buglarian clothing brand - because of its layout and theme</a></span>, <span class="h-link"><a href="https://www.kauaiweddingplanner.com"  class="h-link"> this wedding website with a gorgeous oceanic theme,</a></span>, another <span class="h-link"><a href="https://www.https://goclub.world"  class="h-link">Bulgarian website with a strong y2k background</a></span> - which had a y2k theme I looked further for stumbling across this clothing website<span class="h-link"><a href="https://namedcollective.com/collections/shop-our-sh-t"  class="h-link">The Named Collective (FLASH WARNING)</a></span>  </p>

        <p>The last page to my website is the gallery, which is supposed to be <span class="h-light">an outlook towards my interests and overall attempt at recreating my ideas, simultaniously showcasing my abilities to manage feedback, reflect and attempt.</span></p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>

        <p>With this page being one of my bigger inspirations for my website, <span class="h-light">I found great use from the assistance, Petra</span> gave me so, I could look into how to finish the key pages for my wesbite which give it's identity - the Gallery page.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Through previous advice from Petra, I got around the realization of my idea about a <span class="h-light">Gallery page.</span> She adviced me to get familiar with <span class="h-light">implementing SVGs, which I will be trying to do when I begin that part of my website.</span> Asking for how to recreate another webpage's layout named

        <h4>Decision</h4>
        <p><span class="h-light">I will be attempting to implement the feedback, Petra gave me now that I'm done with my docuemntation,</span> but its <span class="h-light">uncertain, not guaranteed because of the group effort.</span> </p>

        <h4> Reflection </h4>
        <p>Through reseach, I've made this apparent to both myself, and defined into my docuemntation, argumenting my decisions. This way, I have both influenced my personal development, and strenghtened the ideas behind my website's theme and structure - finding it <span class="h-light">crucial that, I did my research.</span></p>

        <p>simultaniously, I have actively<span class="h-light">had clear communication with my teachers - stakeholders - about my idea, have received guidance, most improtantly when, I've fallen short and, I believe that this effort, I've been putting in will pay off.</span></p>

        <h2>Feedback and Reflection</h2>

        <h3>Continuous feedback loop helping prove my progress...</h3>

        <h4> ACTION </h4>
       
        <p>For my <span class="h-light"> Professional skills</span> - communication with teachers, coaches, and colleagues better, is something, I knew, yet have been practiving more and more as of lately. I sat down with my coach, and discussed with them, my progress, shared some insights about other talks, I've had that have helped me improve myself. I came to realize, though the talks with Chris and Lars where, I had fallen short. Petra's simple, yet great advice has been really beneficial for the development of the website.</p> 
        
        <p>On the <span class="h-light">Technical side</span> as well, I ahve been actively improving, becomign faster, understanding my field better, grasping concepts, that I've been impelmenting with the right approach. I however got side-tracked at a point. I was getting too focused on the ideal structure of the website to the point that all, I was doing for a short time is procrastinate, and not begin my project - which is an issue that, I have now resolved, through communication with Corrie and Dirk, mostly.</p>

        <h4> Feedback & Decision</h4>

        <p>Throughout our effort as a group I've found myself in a <span class="h-light">untempered, yet fast-paced manouver of the group</span> as a whole. Teachers, us ourselves have noticed that for one reason or another, <span class="h-light">we're not performing to the best of our abilities,</span> because I find us working towards our goals sporadicly, yet we always achieve the end goal - It's the same in a personal plan.<span class="h-light">Through feedback given we believe that we're going to resolve these issues of hesitancy at times - both on group and personal projects.</span> I can only speak for myself, that  <span class="h-light">I feel refined and grown since the beginning of this semester, and that I am ready to move forward.</span> </p>
        
        <p>Throughout our effort as a team we've tried to be as transparent as possible about our opinions. Without the auditional acknowledgement, we came to have later on for each other, the feelings of lessened progression stopped creeping upon us, as thought focusing on other's work and implementing better communication, we've once again become to overcome <span class="h-light">other hurdles each one of us is experiencing, and because of the easy communication with my teammates, which is something that, although, I haven't had much of earlier, I am finding my place it feels like for me. <span class="h-light">I have a feeling that I have become better at communication due to frequent feedbacks and reflections.</span>I find us growing and progressing actively. We had a meeting earlier where we discussed the coding and I think, we're ready to move on to that.</p>

        <h4>Action</h4>

        <p>We had a task about persevierance and the whole meaning of Core Values as a requirement. Through this exersise I rated myself and others. We each got our moments of reflection on our strong and weak sides.</p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>I got evaluated as someone who <span class="h-light">joins well when working, I am best at giving and receiving opininons, though I sometimes get distracted.</span> I have come to <span class="h-light">understand things about myself,</span>though previously evident we're not certain to me until this reflection. This has both helped my work at Fontys, as well as my personal life.</p>

        <h4>Decision</h4>
        <p>After this needed evaluation, <span class="h-light">we synergized better than before and have begun managing as a team, once again.</span>We've come to the decision to work on the group website over the weekend, managing what's left of our personal websites on the side, for the greater good of the team.</p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>We graded eachother on our skills. This evaluation definately <span class="h-light">helped us a lot to grow as a team</span> and fix past mistakes we've made</p>


        <p>We talked in dept about our strong features, our shortcomings, how we could change for the better in certain aspects, how we could contribute to eachother as well. <span class="h-light">And from the feedback that I've received, I believe that, I've improved greatly as of late</span> - emphesised by other teachers' feedback as well.</p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        
        <p>I have prioritised it ever since, <span class="h-light">creating an ideantity for it off of the inspirations I had for a week to ensure that every teacher that can view it in its best state.</span></p>
        
        <p> While making this really important part of my website, <span class="h-light">I went through struggles on how to implement it with the style I was going for.</span> I tried  <span class="h-light">making a slideshow out of the menu as it was familiar to me after some exersises we did in class</span> with the one-page website, Pokemon card and Slideshow. So I made a Figma pitch of it and then tried to implement it on my website. This took me 3 days, the assistance of  <span class="h-light">sources such as W3, Chat GPT, Stack Overflow, Flexbox-Tips and Tricks CSS and feedback from peers.</span> Here's how it looked previously.</p>

        <div class="image-align">
          <img src="webpagebefore.png" class="image" alt="before Feedback">
          <img src="afterwebsite.png" class="image" alt="after Feedback">
          <img src="research1.png" class="image" alt="research">
          <img src="research2.png" class="image" alt="research">          
        </div>

        <p>Through JS that I addded to hide and unhide the two menus I managed to realize my idea. This way I kept my layout while still considering teachers feedback and trying to ensure the smoothest experience possible.</p>

        <div class="image-align">
          <img src="messywebpage2.png" class="image" alt="before Feedback">
          <img src="messywebpage.png" class="image" alt="after Feedback"> 
          <img src="webpagefeedback.png" class="image" alt="after Feedback">            
          <img src="final_page.png" class="image" alt="after Feedback">         
        </div>  

        <!-- here -->
        <h4>Decision</h4>

        <p>I took this decision by evaluating what I <span class="h-light">would be losing if I was to change the style now.</span> To get to this final version I had to do research on it. These were my main sources. <span class="h-light">One is code</span><a class="h-link" href="https://codepen.io/dwinatech/pen/NWRPOdE"><span class="h-light"> that I used from a template I found.</a>This is its most barebones version which, I have greatly changed to suit my website. The code's use here is a navigation bar and multiple sections, common for article pages.</span>This system allows for easy navigation through different sections of the document using the links in the navigation bar. Each section is <span class="h-light">well-organized with headers, paragraphs, and lists, which makes it suitable for documentation which fits the way the rest of the website is structured with clear showcases of content.</span> The last one is inspiration for the webpage I found.</p>

        <div class="image-align">

          <img src="tech_research1.png" class="image" alt="web "> 
          <img src="tech_research2.png" class="image" alt="web">            
          <img src="wireframes.png" class="image" alt="final">          
        </div>  

        <p> I used JS as mentioned in the group project as well as in the personal website. I have listed my sources and have understood the code I have implemented into my design. 
        <br> The first function is a <span class="h-light">toggleLists()</span> function which controls two lists and their contents are visible on a webpage by <span class="h-light">toggling a "hidden" class, this way it ensures only one set is displayed at a time.</span> This was needed as I realized whenver I was implementing the slideshow with flexbox that, it's impossible that way so I did my research on documentation websites adn types. Links:<span class="h-link"><a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/document-management-trends/">Tiny</a><span class="h-link"><a href="https://medium.com/@ohansemmanuel/flexbox-is-awesome-but-its-not-welcome-here-a90601c292b6">Medium</a>,
          <span class="h-link"><a href=" https://document360.com/blog/software-documentation-tools/">Document360</p></a>.

        <div class="image-align">
          <img src="tech_research5.png" class="image" alt="breakign slideshow"> 
          <img src="tech_research4.png" class="image" alt="code">
          <img src="tech_research3.png" class="image" alt="web ">         
        </div>  

        <p>This code initializes on page load, adding click listeners to menu links for our shop section. It toggles section visibility, scrolls smoothly to selected areas, and dynamically shows relevant content, improving user navigation. </p>

        <h4> Reflection</h4>

        <p>The building of this website was a challenge primarily because of <span class="h-light">how much content I had to fit.</span> With the confusion I had until, I managed to break things <span class="h-light">one by one.</span></p>

        <p>One of the biggest mistakes that occured with the buildign of this page was <span class="h-light">structure. Even afte getting the template, I needed to changes, add the symentic structure that was missing, figuring out a problem with the menu, mistakenly name something wrong, etc.</span> so I could find issues that had risen when implementing the template. Later, I would fix it.</p>
        
        <p> <span class="h-light">Through feedback I've implemented once and once again,</span> documenting previous iterations for most of the feedback I've submitted, thus ensuring I've covered this <span class="h-light">skill multiple times. And my feedback checkpoints say the same.</span> That though I've felt behind at times, I've never given up no matter how hard it has got for me at times.</p>

        <h3>You show iterations in the work process and you explain how feedback from users and experts has contributed to your design choices. Your design meets the needs of the end user and is aesthetically justified.</h3>

        <p>By using the MoSCoW method reviously mentioned, we established which elements, functions and pages are most imprtant for our website. I started creatign wireframes which, we would later expand on and improve using research I did to later refine the webpage and bring it to its final version</p>

        </div>

        <p>Through doing <span class="h-light">pitches for the website, and adding the most important elements using the MoSCoW method</span> (we as a team did), I created half of the website's layout, starting with the first version based on further research I later did and displayed in Figma which is something, I have showcased multiple times.</p>
        
        <p>After creating some Figma pitches me and another teammate split the website and each did the wireframe for it in Figma.</p>

        <div class="image-align">

        <p>In the refinement of the website, that I have previously documented, we used the redesign I did based on previous feedback from teachers in the final HTML version of the website.</p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <!-- feedback -->
        <p> although, we managed to create the prototype as invisioned, we recognized the disbalance in our team's coordination. We had great communication and synergized well while distributing tasks, but when it came to show our idea, I froze up and revealved only half of it. Teachers pointed out how lack-luster me and my behaviours came across adn that we didn't capture the feeling that we were supposed to, that we didn't synergize with our other teammates who had performed exceptionally. The way we delivered the project definately didn't come of much help to us.</p>

        <h4>Decision</h4>

        <p>After a discission we reflected on our shortcoming with this project - what went well and what we will be improving next time. </p>

        <h4> Reflection</h4>

        <p>We spoke of how the presentation went. We discussed how the way we prolonged the project costed us so much, as we had everything for our website available then, but we weren't all mentally prepared. We made a qucik plan on how to execute the presentation given feedback and the iterations made thus far but without practice it was impossible for me to not become <span class="h-light"> chaotic - as I would be described by my teachers</span> and the group as underprepared and I feel great shame from that event as troubles are common during presentations and I should've acted different - not go though 1/3rd of our website. <span class="h-light">the group project is now a priority.</span> We distributed parts equally between the 4 of us. <span class="h-light">For now will be linking pages together though a nav bar, adding a footer as well to the first webpage,</span> and then will be sending it to the others. But we believe that though our docuemntation we can overcome these errors as we've continued to reflect and better ourselves.

        <h2>Target Group</h2>

        <h3>Target audience: Researchers focusing on cannabis (weed) use and its effects.</h3>

        <h3>Action: </h3>

        <p> Our leader conducted a study and I assisted in the reseach we did where we created a Google Forms thtough which we would share a surveys related to cannabis to better understand our audience and possible consumers. Medical benefits, and societal impact.</p>

        <h3>Feedback: </h3>

        <p>Analyzing data given to us from Google Forms, understanding the psychological, and social implications of cannabis use, that way we planned and developed our idea further. That's how we went from a Coffee Shop delivery service called "Blazed Beanz" to "Goods" and changed our branding to be more like takeaway but for people who smoke weed.</p>

        <h3>Decision: </h3>
        <p>Drawing conclusions and making recommendations based on research outcomes regarding policy, treatment strategies, and public health initiatives. These were all things we had to get familiar with before beginning work on our porject as cannabis is still illegal at most places. We strategized to make our business a small local one having good reach in a legal area and through layout research that I've previously done, I will reference once again..</p>

        <h3>Reflection:</h3> 
        
        <p>Considering the broader implications of research findings on cannabis legalization, public perception, and future research directions, we decided to try and market this more outstanding idea. Me and my team chose to lean into this diverse research into cannabis use to ensure that we have a solid marketing understanding and are obedient of any policies.
